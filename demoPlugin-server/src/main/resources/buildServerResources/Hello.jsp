<h2>Automated Release Notes</h2>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository
even several times a day.Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems as soon as possible.
Releasing software with a Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline can greatly increase the speed with which code gets released.
CI Pipelines can largely replace manual processes of releasing. When it comes to the content of a release however, most tools focus
on relating each build to a set of changes in source control. This is great for developers to determine the source of a bug in a
particular build, but the source control does not hold much value when it comes to communicating the business content of the build.
When a build gets deployed, the business wants to know what the content of the build is, so that they know what to test, as well
as what can be released to production. This often means a manual step in the CI process is necessary: the developer must look up
the work items in the work item tracking software, and enter them manually into the release tracking software. The goal of this
project is to eliminate that manual step of entering release notes by integrating the build pipeline with Work Item Tracking
software.
